# FakeBank CTF Report

**Objective:**  
Practice ethical hacking in a controlled TryHackMe environment called FakeBank.

**Tools Used:**  
- TryHackMe lab environment  
- Linux terminal (Kali)  
- Nmap  
- Burp Suite  
- Hydra  

**Steps Taken:**  
1. Scanned the target for open ports and services.  
2. Enumerated the web application and identified login vulnerabilities.  
3. Used brute-force and SQL injection to gain access (in a sandboxed lab).  
4. Captured the flag for completion.  

**Learning Outcome:**  
- Understood how insecure login systems can be exploited.  
- Learned safe and legal penetration testing methods.  

**Note:**  
This was done in a **legal training environment** (TryHackMe), not on a real bank or live system.
